# 🥷🏾 Josh

I am a self-taught programmer with over three years of experience in Python development. Despite starting a web development course, I found my true passion in Python programming and have been dedicated to mastering the language ever since. As a high-demand language, I have developed various projects and applications using Python, showcasing my proficiency in the language. At just 17 years old, I am excited to continue exploring new technologies and expanding my skills as a developer.
